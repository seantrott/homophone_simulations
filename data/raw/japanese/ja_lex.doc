1.  Summary abstract

The LDC Japanese lexicon was compiled primarily for support of the
project on Large Vocabulary Conversational Speech Recognition (LVCSR),
sponsored by the U.S. Department of Defense.

The LDC Japanese lexicon consists of 80,688 words, and contains
separate information fields with morphological, phonological, and
stress information for each word.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

2.  Word segmentation

Word segmentation principles for Japanese were formulated in
collaboration with LVCSR Callhome contractors, especially Yoshiko Ito
and Paul Bamberg at Dragon Systems.  Certain dialect words, tagged
with "dia" in the morphology field, are treated differently from the
principles described below (for example, dialect-specific contractions
never occur in uncontracted form, and are therefore listed in the
lexicon in the way that most captures their productivity).

In general,

1.  Compounds

A compound is treated as a unitary word (i.e., not segmented).

2.  Conventionalized expressions

Common expressions in conversational Japanese are treated as unitary.

3.  noun+'suru'

'suru' is separated from the preceding noun except in cases where its
phonological form changes in combination with the noun, i.e. +[suru]
-> +[zuru].  Cases of noun+'zuru' are generated by the LDC transducer.

4.  noun+'na'

'na' is separated from the preceding noun; nouns and 'na' are listed
separately in the lexicon.  However, all nouns that can take +na to
become adjectives are tagged in the morphological field to indicate
so.

5.  Auxiliaries

The following verb/adjective auxiliaries are treated as separate
words.  All seven verb stems that can combine with them are listed
separately in the lexicon as well.

        deshita         mashita         masu           	nakereba        
        taku           	takatta         nakatta         nai	tai

6.  Particles

Particles are treated as separate words, except that multi-
particle combinations are not segmented (e.g., 'wa', 'dewa').

7.  Honorifics

Honorifics are treated as separate from the preceding word.

8.  Rendaku

Words undergoing rendaku, or sequential voicing, are treated as
unsegmented compounds.

9.  Count forms

Irregular count forms, in which there is phonological interaction
between the counter and what follows, are treated as unitary words
and not segmented.

10.  Contracted forms

Contractions are not transcribed as unitary words, but rather (1)
listed as separate words in the lexicon (e.g., "itte" and "oku"
separately for "ittoku"), and (2) segmented as two words in the
Callhome transcripts, followed by a comment such as [[contraction]].
Note that dialect-specific forms are exceptions to this principle.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

3.  Lexicon information fields

The LDC Japanese lexicon contains seven tab-separated information
fields:

Field 1:  orthographic form in kanji or katakana, or hiragana if
	  the word is only written in hiragana (headword)
Field 2:  orthographic form in hiragana
Field 3:  orthographic form in romaji
Field 4:  pronunciation of the headword
Field 5:  morphological analysis of the headword
Field 6:  frequency of the headword in the 80 training transcripts
	  from the LDC Japanese Callhome telephone speech corpus
Field 7:  glosses of the headword

Fields 1-3 containing orthography should be self-explanatory.
Information on the other four fields is given in the sections below.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

4.  Pronunciation

The fourth field of the lexicon contains representations of 
pronunciations, according to the following allophone table:

The following romaji represenations were automatically converted, 
in the pronunciation field, to the corresponding pronunciation
representation shown below:

v               b       cf. comments below

Comments on the pronunciation field:

(1) The ei-ee, ou-oo conversions listed above were hand-checked,
because there are exceptions.  ei-ee or oi-oo conversions do not apply
when e/i and o/i are separated by a morphological boundary, nor do
they generally apply to foreign words (e.g., supein 'Spain').  When
both ei-ee, and ou-oo appeared acceptable, both pronunciations were
given in the pronunciation field, separated by /.

(2) Some orthographic representations in Japanese no longer match the
current pronunciation; in particular, particles have often undergone
some reduction (e.g., ha-wa, wo-o).  Pronunciations for these cases
have been added by hand.

(3) The foreign sound v(a) is sometimes written in a non-standard
katakana in an effort to preserve the original sound, but in
fact, it's generally pronounced as /b(a)/ (e.g. adviser ->
adobaizaa), and has been represented as such in the pronunciation
field.

(4) Variant pronunciations of individual words have not been added,
but some systematic variants have been given in the pronunciation
field:

        1. The i-y alternation and compensatory lengthening before /u/:
                simpojiumu/simpojyuumu  'symposium'
        2. Certain cases of onset insertion:
                 baai/bawai     'case'
        3. Variation in the treatment of 'ia' in foreign words:
                roshia/roshiya  'Russia'
                girishia/girisha        'Greece'

Further comments on pronunciation:

The following phonological phenomena were not incorporated into the
pronunciation field, but are listed here in case they may be of use.

(1)  Moraic N usually assimilates to the following consonant:

N-bilabial ->   m-lab.          toNbo   tombo   /dragonfly/
N-coronal  ->   n-cor.          kaNtaN  kantaN  /easy/
N-dorsal   ->   *ng-dor.        keNka   kengka  /fight/
                                *ng:velar nasal
N       ->      N               kaNtaN  kantaN  /easy/

Also, the velar nasal 'ng' and velar 'g' alternate in low level
phonetic realization.

(2)  i,u devoicing: in general, these vowels are devoiced when they
occur between /k,s,t,h(f),p,sh/ and before /k,s,t,h(f),p/; for
example, /i/ in kiku, /u/ in gakusha.  However, this process has
exceptions too numerous to list exhaustively.  The most notable
exceptions are:

        -when the vowel is in H accent mora followed by L accent mora.
                /i/ in shison is not devoiced
        -when there are two adjacent moras with the same condition,
         only one of them is devoiced.
                first /i/ devoiced, second /i/ intact in kikikata
                first /i/ intact, shi devoiced in rekishiteki
        -word final k,s,t,p,sh with L accent
                ki in aki, su in arimasu not devoiced

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

6.  Frequency

The frequency given in field six is with respect to the 80 training
transcripts in the LDC Japanese Callhome corpus.  Frequency is
computed according to the occurrence of the kanji, katakana, or hiragana
sequence that comprises the word according to the first field in the
lexicon.

Word frequency counts in other corpora were not available because of
the necessity of regularizing word segmentation (by hand, at this
point).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

7.  Glosses

Alternate glosses given in field seven of the lexicon are separated 
by a single slash; glosses corresponding to different parts-of-speech, 
as listed in the tag column, are separated by double slashes.
