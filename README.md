The CMU Pronouncing dictionary transcriptions maps each of ~50k orthographic wordforms to one or more ARPABET transcriptions. Every ARPABET symbol can be mapped to a unique IPA symbol. CMU dictionary transcriptions also include numbers next to every vowel that indicates the stress (unstressed = 0, secondary = 1, primary = 2); if the student decides to remove stress information, they should note that there are no schwas in the CMU transcriptions, so the resulting transcriptions would be pervasively more stressed than actual English. Some of the transcriptions come from an unknown dictionary and the rest come from random, anonymous submissions over the last 30 years from people affiliated with computer science at CMU and third party-submitted transcriptions. 

The student may find it easier to access the CMU transcriptions - or other information you want, including prior probabilities, neighborhood density, and phonotactically licit nonce words (not in the CMU dict) annotated for their phonotactic probability - from the Irvine Phonotactic Online Dictionary. IPhOD's data (or at least most of it) and Python libraries that will calculate various phonotactic probability measures are also included in Phonological Corpus Tools; PCT also includes a GUI. PCT also includes functionality that makes it easy to convert or view IPhOD's transcriptions in whatever transcription alphabet the user wants, based on whatever phonetic feature matrix they want; several well-known feature matrices and feature matrix ‚ü∫ transcription alphabet mappings are available out of the box.
